#The Hospital Management Package 
is a PL/SQL-based system designed to streamline patient management in a hospital setting. The project allows efficient handling of patient and doctor information by providing functionalities to:

Insert multiple patient records at once using bulk processing

Display all patient records through a cursor-based function

Admit patients and track the number of patients currently admitted

The system is implemented as a PL/SQL package (hospital_pkg) with procedures and functions for bulk insertion, patient admission, and information retrieval. It demonstrates the use of collections, bulk operations (FORALL), and data consistency management with commits. Test scripts are included to verify the correct operation of all features.

This project is ideal for learning PL/SQL packages, bulk data handling, and database-driven application logic in a healthcare context.
